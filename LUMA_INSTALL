Mumbles should not be installed the normal luma way using pip. Mumbles
relies on pygtk, which is a complete pain in the ass to compile, but
comes with the fedora system python, so our compromise is to install
Mumbles using the system python (which places its scripts into /usr/bin).

To install Mumbles, puppet should be setup to run:
   ``sudo /usr/bin/python setup.py install``
from this source directory.
