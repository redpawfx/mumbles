Welcome to Mumbles

Mumbles is a plugin-driven, DBus based notification system written for the Gnome desktop. Similar to libnotify notifications and Growl for OSX (http://growl.info), Mumbles aims to provide a modern notification system for the GNU/Linux Desktop.

-- Pre-release Notes --
* Version 0.4.2 includes a new generic dbus plugin that allows simple additions of
mumbles alerts for dbus signals. Some of the plugins from the previous release have
been removed in favor of this method. At this time, you will have to copy the conf file
by hand - we plan on having this happen automatically by release, but make sure you copy

src/dbus.conf.sample
to
~/.mumbles/dbus.conf

And check out the options!

* Also, 0.4.2 includes a new libnotify interceptor. libnotify messages will now be replaced with mumbles alerts.
If you prefer to not have this happen, delete the libnotify .egg file.
